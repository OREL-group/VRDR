VR Anatomy:

Immersive VR anatomy experiences offer a journey through the human body. Utilizing VR technology, users explore detailed 3D models, dissect virtual cadavers, fostering a profound understanding of anatomical structures. This hands-on approach transcends traditional methods, enhancing educational outcomes.

Model Organism:

Understanding model organisms is critical for studying genetics. VR integration allows users to explore non-human species used in labs for understanding biological processes. This immersive experience aids in comprehending the intricacies of model organisms such as fruit flies, nematode worms, and zebrafish.

VR Morris Water Maze:

In VR Morris water maze experiments, participants navigate a computer-generated maze, enhancing spatial learning and memory studies. This controlled, immersive environment advances behavioral neuroscience and cognitive assessments.

Implementation Status:

Certain aspects, like documentation and testing, are pending. Post-GSoC, commitment to completing these tasks and continued contribution for project enhancement is assured.

I used **unity 3d** and **blender** and for creating and optimising models.
